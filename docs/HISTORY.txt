        * we added events to relations on each connect and disconnect.
	  within this implementation some cleanup were done. 
	  the events are used for exampe by RelationsIndex, but you
	  can subscribe to them also to fulfill task need to be done
	  on connect or disconnect.

        * allowedTypesByInterface now also supports zope3 interfaces

2006-03-30  Daniel Nouri  <daniel (dot) nouri at gmail (dot) com>

	* utils.py (adddeleteVocab): I put the ``adddelete_vocab`` script
	onto the filesystem while adding a check for
	``ModifyPortalContent`` on context.  The Python script still
	exists, but it's only an alias now.  Also added tests, which the
	script didn't have.

2006-03-01  Jens Klein <jens@bluedynamics.com>

        * field.py: i18n moved in Archetypes 1.4 to 
	Products.Archetypes.generator.i18n

2006-02-04  Daniel Nouri  <dpunktnpunkt at web.de>

	* tests: Added more tests to check if multiple refs per triple
	(i.e. same source, target, relationship) are working.  (Note that
	this currently requires the dpunktnpunkt-multipleref branch of
	Archetypes and that it's disallowed by default.

2006-01-28  Daniel Nouri  <dpunktnpunkt at web.de>

	* components/inverse.py (InverseImplicator.implyOnDisconnect):
	Improvement of implementation.

2006-01-26  Daniel Nouri  <dpunktnpunkt at web.de>

	* components/inverse.py (InverseImplicator): New implementation
	that no longer assumes that there's only one reference with the
	same relationship between two objects.

	* interfaces.py (IRuleset.implyOnConnect): No longer care about
	whether a reference with the same triple of (source, target,
	relationship) already exists.

	* config.py (ALLOW_MULTIPLE_REFS_PER_TRIPLE): Added configuration
	option for updateReferences argument of
	ReferenceEngine.addReference.  It's turned off by default.

	* interfaces.py (IRuleset.implyOnConnect)
	(IPrimaryImplicator.connect): Added metadata keyword argument that
	lets you provide attributes for the reference.  Note that this is
	subject to change and will probably be moved out of the public
	API.

	* interfaces.py (IReferenceConnectionProcessor.process): Elements
	of ``disconnect`` may also be UIDs of reference objects.

2005-11-22 Jens Klein <jens@bluedynamics.com>

	* fixed hiding of tools from navigation and tabs

2005-08-10  Daniel Nouri  <dpunktnpunkt at web.de>

	* ruleset.py (Library.__implements__): Fixed the faulty
	IActionProvider implementation of Library.

2005-07-20  Daniel Nouri  <dpunktnpunkt at web.de>

	* components/cardinality.py: Applied patch by David Baehrens that
	allows us to define source cardinality with CardinalityConstraint.

2005-07-07  Daniel Nouri  <dpunktnpunkt at web.de>

	* ruleset.py (XMLImportExport.schema): Use the accessor as the
	default_method.

	* utils.py (AllowedTypesByIface._verifyObjectPaste): Use
	PortalFolderBase's _verifyObjectPaste as we're actually not
	inheriting from PortalFolder.

	* tests/testRuleset.py (TestRuleset.testRenameRulesetInLibrary):
	Import transaction instead of using the global get_transaction.

	* processor.py (process): Import transaction instead of using the
	global get_transaction.
	
2005-06-03  Daniel Nouri  <dpunktnpunkt at web.de>

	* components/contentreference.py (ContentReferenceFinalizer):
	Added isPrimary attribute to CRF.

2005-05-28  Daniel Nouri  <dpunktnpunkt at web.de>

	* Extensions/Install.py (install_tools): Don't add library to
	metaTypesNotToList.

2005-05-18  Daniel Nouri  <dpunktnpunkt at web.de>

	* skins/relations/relations_adddelete_vocab.py, model/*, tests/relations_sample.xml, tests/testXMLImportExport.py, doc/Overview.txt, interfaces.py, ruleset.py, field.py:
	Merged relations_xml_import_export branch.  Adds import/export
	capabilities to Rules, Rulesets, Library and RulesetCollections.
	
2005-02-21  Daniel Nouri  <dpunktnpunkt at web.de>

	* interfaces.py (IRuleset.getComponents): This replaces the earlier
	private _filterByInterface.

	* interfaces.py (IRuleset.listActionsFor): Added a method which I
	forgot to put in the interface earlier.

	* interfaces.py (IVocabularyProvider.getSearchTerms): This should allow
	us to interface with ATReferenceBrowserWidget in a reasonable manner.

	* components/types.py (PortalTypeConstraint.getSearchTerms):
	Comply with IVocabularyProvider.getSearchTerms .
	
2005-02-16  Daniel Nouri  <dpunktnpunkt at web.de>

	* doc/Overview.txt: Doctest examples.

2005-02-06  Daniel Nouri  <dpunktnpunkt at web.de>

	* doc/Overview.txt: Added Developer's Documentation.  More to
	come.
	
	* interfaces.py: Cleaned up a bit.
	
2005-02-02  Daniel Nouri  <dpunktnpunkt at web.de>

	* field.py: Slimmed field.py by removing reimplemented methods
	_Vocabulary and Vocabulary of ReferenceField.  The field's purpose
	needs to be made clear, still.  See XXX comments.
	
2005-01-27  Daniel Nouri  <dpunktnpunkt at web.de>

	* ruleset.py (RulesetCollection): Implemented a "Ruleset Collection"
	type that allows to categorise Rulesets inside the Library.
	
	* ruleset.py (RulesetAwareContainer): Factored out methods
	invokeFactory and _setObject of Library into class
	RulesetAwareContainer.

2005-01-25  Daniel Nouri  <dpunktnpunkt at web.de>

	* *: Massive renaming.  'Jig' becomes 'Ruleset',
	'ReferenceJigRegistry' becomes 'Library' etc.  These changes not
	only affect portal type names, but also classes & variables.
	These changes are not backwards compatible (i.e., no way to
	migrate) and they're not tested thoroughly.
	
2005-01-13  Daniel Nouri  <dpunktnpunkt at web.de>

	* jig.py (ReferenceJig.listActionsFor): Remove duplicate actions.

	* skins/relations/relations_listrefs.py: Added helper script for
	'relations_form', which now lists existing refs along with their
	actions.  'relations_form' still needs improvement.
	
	* interfaces.py (IReferenceActionProvider): Added subtype of
	IJigComponent.
	
2005-01-08  Daniel Nouri  <dpunktnpunkt at web.de>

	* skins/relations/relations_form.cpt: Added an overview form that will
	list existing references.
	
	* skins/relations/relations_adddelete.cpt: Renamed from relations_form.

	* utils.py (getReferenceableTypes): Added function that returns a list
	of portal type strings of all referenceable types.
	
	* Extensions/Install.py (install_tools): Fixed metaTypesNotToList
	feature on install, which wasn't using the right meta_type.

2005-01-02  Daniel Nouri  <dpunktnpunkt at web.de>

	* components/contentreference.py, tests/testComponents.py: Added
	component "ContentReferenceFinalizer", which associates portal objects
	with references.

	* jig.py (ReferenceJig._forEachDo): Prevent acquiring method from self
	if it's not implemented in the component.

2005-01-01  Daniel Nouri  <dpunktnpunkt at web.de>

	* Extensions/Install.py (install_tools): Fixed hiding in navtree; check
	for the existance of a 'portal_properties.navtree_properties' to not
	break all tests. :-)

	* brain.py (makeBrainAggrFromBrain): More explanatory exception message
	when no metadata could be found in a source.
	
2004-10-21  Daniel Nouri  <dpunktnpunkt@web.de>

	* tests/*: Removed calls to CMFTestCase.setupCMFSite(), which were done
	too early.

2004-10-15  Daniel Nouri  <dpunktnpunkt@web.de>

	* COPYRIGHT, LICENSE: Added copyright information.

	* jig.py (ReferenceJigRegistry._setObject): Copied referencejigs are
	registered properly now.

2004-10-05  Daniel Nouri  <dpunktnpunkt@web.de>

	* schema.py (ReferenceJigSchema): Added 'about' field to referencejig's
	schema.

2004-10-04  Daniel Nouri  <dpunktnpunkt@web.de>

	* jig.py (ReferenceJigRegistry.getJig): Restored old way of looking
	up a jig by its id, which involves two catalog lookups. 'targetId'
	index of 'reference_catalog' seems to be broken.

	This fixes a bug where renaming a jig would cause a lookup to fail.

	* README.txt: Revamped README. Also, some minor code changes according
	to new terms.

2004-10-02  Daniel Nouri  <dpunktnpunkt@web.de>

	* jig.py (ReferenceJigRegistry.getJigs): Made ReferenceJigRegistry
	an OrderedBaseFolder. 'getJigs' now returns jigs in the order in which
	they appear in the registry.

	* jig.py (ReferenceJig._afterRename): Set relationship attribute for
	references that belong to us on rename.

	* jig.py (ReferenceJigRegistry._setObject): Added function only
	to assist ReferenceJig in finding out when it is renamed.

	* jig.py (ReferenceJig.implyOnConnect): When connecting, we now put up
	a reference between the jig and the ref.

	* tests/testJig.py (TestReferenceJig.testRenameJigInRegistry): Test
	the new 'referencejig rename -> ref relationship attrs change'
	behaviour.
	
	* tests/testJig.py (TestReferenceJig.testForward): Fixed bug with a
	ref catalog search.
	
2004-09-25  Daniel Nouri  <dpunktnpunkt@web.de>

	* tests/testJig.py (TestJigRegistry.testRenameRegistry): Added test
	to ensure that the jig registry may not be renamed.

	* schema.py: Added module: Schema definitions for jig module, and other
	common schemas.

	* utils.py (AllowedTypesByIface._verifyObjectPaste): Use _setObject
	of 'portal_types' instead of setattr. This fixes renaming of jigs and
	components yet again.

2004-09-24  Daniel Nouri  <dpunktnpunkt@web.de>

	* components/types.py (PortalTypeConstraint.makeVocabulary): Fixed bug
	where filtering a vocabulary would behave differently than creating it.

2004-09-22  Daniel Nouri  <dpunktnpunkt@web.de>
	
	* utils.py (AllowedTypesByIface._verifyObjectPaste): A temporary and
	rather hackish solution for a bug that would hinder renaming jigs
	and components.
	AllowedTypesByIface feels more and more like a hack.

	* tests/testJig.py (TestReferenceJig.testRenameJigInRegistry): Added
	test for the jig/component rename bug.
	
	* Extensions/Install.py (uninstall): Working around a bug with
	QuickInstaller thinking we own ['mimetypes_registry',
	'portal_transforms', 'archetype_tool', 'uid_catalog',
	'reference_catalog'].

2004-09-20  Daniel Nouri  <dpunktnpunkt@web.de>

	* skins/relations/relations_form_security.vpy: Added check for
	'Modify portal content' permission when using 'relations_form'.

	* skins/relations/relations_form_vocab.py: Removed vocabulary logic
	out of PT. The result is this somewhat bloated script.

	* brain.py (makeBrainAggregate): Made function public.

	* jig.py (ReferenceJigRegistry.listActions): We want to check for
	'Modify portal content' permission for the 'Relations' action.

	* utils.py (isReferenceable): Added new TTW method to assist
	'relations_form_vocab'.
	
2004-09-19  Daniel Nouri  <dpunktnpunkt@web.de>

	* exception.py (ValidationException): Added class level attribute
	__allow_access_to_unprotected_subobjects__, fixing a severe bug with
	'relations_form_validate'.

	* skins/relations/relations_form.cpt: Display error messages in the
	orange box.

2004-09-16  Daniel Nouri  <dpunktnpunkt@web.de>

	* jig.py (ReferenceJigRegistry.listActions): Made ReferenceJigRegistry
	an ActionProvider. All referenceable objects have a 'relations' action
	now.

	* processor.py (process): Made function public.

	* exception.py (ValidationException): Made exception class public.

	* skins/relations/*, TODO: Added form for creating references through
	'processor.process'. Removed TODO item for such a form, added one
	for i18n.

	* jig.py (ReferenceJigRegistry.invokeFactory): Moved automatic
	registration of jigs from _setObject to invokeFactory.

	* components/types.py (PortalTypeConstraint.makeVocabulary): Fixed a
	bug where this method would return [] if allowed target types were the
	empty list.
	
2004-09-10  Daniel Nouri  <dpunktnpunkt@web.de>

	* components/cardinality.py (CardinalityConstraint.doValidate): Renamed
	validate to doValidate to avoid nameclash with 'BaseObject.validate'.

2004-09-07  Daniel Nouri  <dpunktnpunkt@web.de>

	* jig.py (ReferenceJig, ReferenceJigRegistry): Added class docstring.
	Zope returned 404s because of this.

	* TODO, jig.py (ReferenceJig, ReferenceJigRegistry): ReferenceJig's
	and ReferenceJigRegistry's type titles are now "Reference Rulebook" and
	"Rulebook Library" respectively.

2004-09-06  Daniel Nouri  <dpunktnpunkt@web.de>

	* interfaces.py, jig.py, components/*: Removed `jig' argument from
	all calls to IJigComponents. Extended IJigComponent and added a new
	superclass JigComponentBase providing a `getJig' method.

	* jig.py, interfaces.py (IReferenceJig): IReferenceJig.makeVocabulary
	now accepts an optional `targets' argument. Targets, which has a
	default value of None, is forwarded to the first IVocabularyProvider.
	No changes to IVocabularyProvider necessary.

	* utils.py (AllowedTypesByIface): A superclass for ReferenceJig and
	ReferenceJigRegistry that alters PortalFolder's allowedContentTypes
	and invokeFactory behaviour. Method `allowedContentTypes' was a module
	level function before. I had to add invokeFactory.

	* jig.py (JigComponentBase): Added global_allow = 0. Subclasses are
	now by default only addable inside ReferenceJigs.

	* tests/types.py: Deleted. These types were not in use anywhere.

	* TODO: Added two items.
	
2004-08-22  Daniel Nouri  <dpunktnpunkt@web.de>

	* processor.py (process): Changed interface of processor from seperate
	processConnection and processDisconnection to one process function
	with optional connect and disconnect arguments.

	Changed 7 tests to reflect these changes.

2004-08-19  Daniel Nouri  <dpunktnpunkt@web.de>

	* components/inverse.py: Added 'Inverse Implicator' component.

	* tests/testComponents.py (TestInverseImplicator): Test for
	InverseImplicator.

	* brain.py: Changed BrainAggregate to use __getattr__ instead of
	relying on acquisition to get uid brain's attributes.

2004-08-17  Daniel Nouri  <dpunktnpunkt@web.de>

	* components/cardinality.py (CardinalityConstraint): Added
	CardinalityConstraint.

	* tests/testComponents.py (TestCardinalityConstraint): Test for
	CardinalityConstraint.

	* components/types.py (InterfaceConstraint): Added InterfaceConstraint:
	A validator/vocab provider based on PortalTypeConstraint that checks
	for interfaces rather than types.

	* tests/testComponents.py (TestInterfaceConstraint): Added test.

2004-08-16  Daniel Nouri  <dpunktnpunkt@web.de>

	* processor.py: Use a subtransaction and abort it for both
	processConnection and processDisconnection if an exception is thrown.

	* components/types.py: A validator and vocab provider that restricts
	types of source and target.

	* tests/testComponents.py: Test components in module components.

2004-08-15  Daniel Nouri  <dpunktnpunkt@web.de>

	* tests/common.py (createObjects, createJig): Factored out of
	testJig.py.

	* tests/testProcess.py: Test for processConnection and
	processDisconnection.

2004-08-11  Daniel Nouri  <dpunktnpunkt@web.de>

	* TODO: Added file.

	Added jig as the first argument to every component call. Updated
	interfaces and tests accordingly.

2004-08-10  Daniel Nouri  <dpunktnpunkt@web.de>

	* tests/testJig.py (TestJigRegistry.testAllowedContentTypes): Added.

	* jig.py (ReferenceJigRegistry.allowedContentTypes): Override
	allowedContentTypes in Jig Registry as well to the effect that we
	are now able to add any type of objects that implement the
	IReferenceJig interface from the UI.

	* utils.py: Added.

	* utils.py (allowedContentTypesByInterface): Refactored
	allowedContentTypes of ReferenceJig into this.

	* Extensions/Install.py, Extensions/utils.py: Add ReferenceJigRegistry
	to Plone configlets.
	
2004-08-03  Daniel Nouri  <dpunktnpunkt@web.de>

	* interfaces.py: Modified behaviour of IPrimaryImplicator's connect
	and disconnect methods. They now return None if they didn't add or
	delete the reference because it was already there or deleted
	respectively.

	* tests/testJig.py (TestReferenceJig.testDefaultPrimaryImplicator):
	Added.
	
2004-08-01  Daniel Nouri  <dpunktnpunkt@web.de>

	* jig.py (ReferenceJigRegistry): Made ReferenceJigRegistry an AT
	BaseFolder instead of an OFS.Folder. ReferenceJigRegistry will serve
	as a folderish UI for adding jigs.
